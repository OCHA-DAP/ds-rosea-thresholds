# Summary

This analysis provides a comprehensive assessment of population exposure to ASAP warning thresholds across the ROSEA region.

## Key Contributions

1. **Methodology**: Standardized approach for calculating population exposure to agricultural warnings
2. **Data Integration**: Successfully merged ASAP warnings with WorldPop population data
3. **Threshold Framework**: Implemented cumulative threshold calculations (1+, 2+, 3+, 4+)
4. **Temporal Analysis**: Monthly time series enabling trend analysis
5. **Operational Tool**: Reproducible pipeline for ongoing monitoring

## Applications

The results of this analysis can support:

- **Early Warning Systems**: Population-based exposure metrics for decision-making
- **Resource Planning**: Understanding scale and distribution of potential needs
- **Comparative Analysis**: Cross-country and temporal comparisons
- **Advocacy**: Evidence-based communication about agricultural stress impacts

## Future Development

Potential enhancements to the analysis include:

- **Real-time Integration**: Automated updates with latest ASAP data
- **Visualization Dashboard**: Interactive tools for exploring results
- **Predictive Modeling**: Forecasting population exposure based on seasonal patterns
- **Sub-national Analysis**: Extending analysis to administrative level 1 or 2
- **Integration**: Linking with other food security indicators and assessments
