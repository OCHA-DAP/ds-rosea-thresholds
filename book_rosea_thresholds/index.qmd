# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book presents the analysis of population exposure to ASAP (Agricultural Stress Analysis Programme) warning thresholds across countries in the ROSEA (Regional Office for Southern and Eastern Africa) region.

## Overview

The ASAP threshold analysis pipeline calculates monthly population exposure to different warning levels, providing critical insights for humanitarian decision-making and early warning systems. The analysis combines:

- **ASAP Warning Data**: Agricultural stress indicators at administrative level 2
- **WorldPop Population Data**: High-resolution population estimates for 2020
- **Threshold-based Analysis**: Cumulative exposure calculations for different warning levels

## Key Outputs

The primary output of this analysis is the `monthly_country_exposure.csv` dataset, which contains:

- Monthly country-level population exposure to warning thresholds
- Cumulative metrics (Warning Group 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+)
- Percentage and absolute population exposure figures
- Time series data spanning multiple years

## Target Region

The analysis focuses on 15 countries in the ROSEA region:

**East Africa**: Burundi, Comoros, Djibouti, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe

**Southern Africa**: Angola, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Namibia

## Warning Level Hierarchy

The analysis uses a standardized hierarchy of agricultural warnings:

- **No warning** (0): Normal agricultural conditions
- **Warning Group 1** (1): Watch - Early signs of agricultural stress
- **Warning Group 2** (2): Advisory - Moderate agricultural stress
- **Warning Group 3** (3): Alert - Significant agricultural stress requiring attention
- **Warning Group 4** (4): Emergency - Severe agricultural stress requiring immediate action

Special categories excluded from threshold calculations:
- **Off season** (-1): Areas outside of growing season
- **No crop/rangeland** (-2): Areas unsuitable for agriculture

## Methodology Approach

The analysis employs a population-weighted approach to calculate exposure metrics:

1. **Data Integration**: Merges ASAP warnings with population data at admin2 level
2. **Monthly Aggregation**: Groups data by country and month for temporal analysis
3. **Threshold Calculations**: Computes cumulative exposure (e.g., "Warning 2+" includes Groups 2, 3, and 4)
4. **Statistical Summaries**: Provides both absolute population counts and percentage exposure

This comprehensive approach enables humanitarian actors to understand the scale and distribution of agricultural stress across the region, supporting evidence-based decision-making for food security interventions.
